# Transmitting information by controlling nonlinear oscillators
by Camilloni Andrea, Caponi Luca, Giri Matteo

# Abstract

The secure transmission of information can be managed through the perturbation of chaotic nonlinear oscillators.
This is possible thanks to the utilization of a principle called "ITVC" (Information Transmission via Control), which asserts that any controller used to perfectly synchronize a pair of nonlinear oscillators, including those with chaotic behavior, can be used as a decoder in the information recovery process.
The objective of our project is to verify that a pair of nonlinear oscillators, whether identical or not, can indeed be synchronized through the methods described by the authors of the research ("Leon O. Chua, ”Memristor-The missing circuit element", "L.A.B. Tˆorres and L.A. Aguirre ”Inductorless Chua’s circuit”").
